Oh man, just stumbled outta Black Bag and my mind is like scrambled eggs and loose screws everywhere. The theater was like a zoo — noisy kids, someone dropping popcorn like they’re feeding pigeons at a park. Kept shifting in my seat, my back protesting like I was sitting on a bed of nails.

The movie was like, this chaotic, beautiful mess. You know when you’re dreaming and suddenly you’re in one place, then BAM you’re somewhere else? That’s Black Bag. That car chase scene, like who brings a bag of marbles to a gunfight? Yet somehow, roller-coaster thrilling in a weird zen kind of way. 

> Right, so there’s this bit with the lady in red and the bag — the bag’s almost a character, really, like the way in Toy Story, the way Woody and Buzz are, but not in a cartoony sense, more like a Hitchcock kinda thing with suspense dripping off. And did the guy really just jump off a bridge without a scratch or was that me hallucinating from too much sugar in my soda?

Fell a little in love with the soundtrack, it clung to scenes like melted cheese on a freshly-out-of-the-oven pizza. The techno beat, thumping like my own heart trying to process everything—like what my uncle said about downloading the movie to watch it in parts just to grasp it all. Maybe I should have taken that advice!

Everybody in the film’s got a motive as invisible as a ninja in a shadow. Like every character’s just two seconds away from spontaneously combusting or maybe turning into a squirrel—okay not that weird but seriously, the tension’s like thick soup you can stand a spoon in.

Remembered halfway through, Lucy mentioned to download the movie last week, totally makes sense now. Mumbling dialogues and explosive screams settle like dust until they choke you with curiosity. Shoulda brought earplugs.

Watching this movie is like wandering through a maze with one eye closed and one hand tied behind your back, just rewarding enough to wanna go back in, you know? Seems like a fever dream kinda movie where fragments stick like glitter glue all over your brain, vague but shiny.
